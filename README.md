# Yahtzee_Game
It was a educational project.
Yahtzee is a dice flip game. It was done by me in my second semester at Dokuz Eylul University, computer engineering departmant.

It works basically like this...
Player need to type two name in order to create competitors. Game starts to display game compenents. 
At the end of the game, you can see a hish score table.
If you are enough lucky, your avatar may appear in it.
